In this work, we demonstrated the ability to detect galaxies with an impressive accuracy of 94% using a quantum machine learning model applied to a NASA image. The process began with dividing the original galaxy image into smaller 16x16 pixel patches, which served as our input data for the model. This approach allowed us to break down the complex image into manageable pieces that could be processed more effectively by the quantum machine learning model.

We then encoded and trained the data using a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), inspired by the methods described in the paper "Expressibility and entangling capability of parameterized quantum circuits for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms" (arXiv:1905.10876). The PQC, chosen for its high expressibility and ability to capture complex relationships within the data, was implemented as the core of our quantum machine learning model.

To train the model, we utilized Cross-Entropy as our loss function, a widely used method for classification tasks, ensuring the model optimized for the correct classification of galaxy images. The optimization process was carried out using the L-BFGS algorithm, a well-known gradient-based method that efficiently minimizes the loss function. This entire training and optimization procedure was realized using PyTorch for the classical components and Qiskit Machine Learning for the quantum circuit components.

Through this work, we not only showed the capability of quantum machine learning to classify galaxy images, but also demonstrated the practical application of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which combine the power of quantum circuits with classical optimization techniques. The high accuracy of 94% confirms the potential of quantum-enhanced models in performing complex image classification tasks, such as identifying galaxies in astronomical images, marking an important milestone in the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning.
